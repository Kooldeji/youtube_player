## Released *New* Youtube Player based on Official Iframe API

So, published a new plugin [youtube_player_flutter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/youtube_player_flutter) which is an officially provided way of playing youtube videos, supporting both **Android** and **iOS** platforms.

Note: will keep on updating this plugin too.

## Salient Features

  - Thumbnail Support
  - Youtube-like controls
  - Customizable Controls
  - Supports HD and Full HD quality
  - Playable through <video id> or <link>
  - No need for API Key and no Limitations
  - Supports Live Stream Videos

![DEMO](example_demo.gif) 

## New Features in v3.x.x!
  - Change video quality on-the-fly.
  - Share video with other apps.
  - Fast Forward and Rewind with double tap.
  - Tap-and-hold to enter and exit fullscreen.
  - Auto resize as per the video's aspect ratio.

## Usage

#### 1\. Depend

Add this to you package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  youtube_player: ^3.2.1
```

#### 2\. Install

Run command:

```bash
$ flutter packages get
```

#### 3\. Import

Import in Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:youtube_player/youtube_player.dart';
```

#### 4\. Using Youtube Player
         
```dart
///
/// LOW = 240p
/// MEDIUM = 360p
/// HIGH = 480p
/// HD = 720p
/// FHD = 1080p
/// "source" can be either youtube video ID or link.
///
YoutubePlayer(
    context: context,
    source: "nPt8bK2gbaU",
    quality: YoutubeQuality.HD,
    // callbackController is (optional). 
    // use it to control player on your own.
    callbackController: (controller) {
      _videoController = controller;
    },
),
```
         
#### 5\. Playing livestream videos
Must set isLive property to true in order to play livestream videos.

```dart
YoutubePlayer(
    context: context,
    source: "ddFvjfvPnqk",
    quality: YoutubeQuality.HD,
    **isLive: true,**
),
```

## Note:
In scenario, where one need to navigate to next page and return. 
You'll need to pause the video before navigating, otherwise the video will keep on playing.

```dart
RaisedButton(
    child: Text("Next Page"),
    onPressed: () {
          _videoController.pause();
          Navigator.of(context).push(
               MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NextPage()),
          );
    },
),
```

## Didn't like the controls ?
Don't worry, Got a solution for you. ðŸ˜‰
Set the playermode to NO_CONTROLS, then you can create your own custom controls using the controller obtained from callbackController property.

```dart
YoutubePlayer(
    context: context,
    source: "ddFvjfvPnqk",
    playerMode: YoutubePlayerMode.NO_CONTROLS,
    callbackController: (controller) {
      _videoController = controller;
      },
),
```
